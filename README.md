# VodBot - WIP
Chat controlled VOD rerun/player for live streams - Inspired by Yogscast's YogsCinema

### Concept
Yogscast's YogsCinema, for the uninitiated, is an automed bot that plays back Youtube videos from the Yogscast library on their Twitch channel when no live streams are scheduled. This also has the ability for viewers to vote for upcoming videos as they day goes on. I highly recommend sitting in on a stream to see how it functions.

This always seemed like a very ingenious tool especially for larger channels. Sadly it appears no one has taken on trying to replicate this so I intend to at least make an attempt at this.

This will ve a VERY -WIP- repo. Assume that unless specifically noted here, the code in this repo is very much a work in progress and likely not working as intended. Active development will be stored here here as I go.

### Current design plans
I am currently at the back-of-napkin design stage: The actual video player side will probably be HTML/JS/CSS based and designed to be run as a browser source in your streaming application of choice. Backend control will probably end up being python based.
